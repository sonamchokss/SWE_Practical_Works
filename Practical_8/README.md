# Sorting Algorithms Repository
This repository contains implementations of three fundamental sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and is tested with a sample array to demonstrate its functionality. Plus, there is a performance comparison of the algorithms to analyze their execution time on a larger dataset.

# Implemented Algorithms
- Bubble Sort:
A simple method that repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent items until the list is sorted.

- Merge Sort:
A more efficient approach that divides the list into smaller parts, sorts those, and then combines them back together.

- Quick Sort:
A fast method that picks a "pivot" and organizes the list into smaller parts based on that pivot, sorting them recursively.

- Performance Comparison:
Here it compares how long each sorting method takes to sort a random list of 1,000 numbers. This helps show which algorithm is faster.
