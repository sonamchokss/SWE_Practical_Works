## Overview
This repository provides various implementations and exercises related to Fibonacci sequences, showcasing different methods for calculating Fibonacci numbers, analyzing their performance, and exploring unique properties of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Implemented Features
1. Generating a List of Fibonacci Numbers
- Implements a function to return the first n Fibonacci numbers as a list.
- Useful for applications that require access to the entire Fibonacci sequence up to a certain length.

2. Finding the First Fibonacci Index Exceeding a Given Value
- A function to determine the index of the first Fibonacci number greater than a specified value.
- Can be applied in mathematical problems requiring bounds or limits in the Fibonacci sequence.

3. Checking if a Number is a Fibonacci Number
- A function to verify if a given number is part of the Fibonacci sequence using mathematical properties.
- Enables quick checks without needing to generate the entire sequence.

4. Computing Ratios of Consecutive Fibonacci Numbers
- Generates the ratios between consecutive Fibonacci numbers, which approach the golden ratio.
- Provides insight into the unique convergence properties of Fibonacci numbers.
