# Graph Data Structure and Traversal Algorithms
This repository implements a basic graph data structure in Python, along with various fundamental graph algorithms.

# Implemented Methods
- Adding Vertices and Edges:
Adds new vertices and connect them with edges.

- Graph Representation:
Shows how each vertex is connected to its neighbors.

- Depth-First Search (DFS):
A method to explore the graph by visiting as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

- Breadth-First Search (BFS):
A method that explores all neighbors of a vertex before moving on to the next level.

- Finding All Paths:
This method finds all possible paths between two vertices in the graph.

- Checking Graph Connectivity:
Determines if there is a path between every pair of vertices.
