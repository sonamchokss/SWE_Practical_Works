## This repository demonstrates data structure applications using stacks and queues:
1. Postfix Expression Evaluation: Uses a stack to evaluate postfix expressions efficiently.

2. Queue with Two Stacks: Implements a queue using two stacks for FIFO order.

3. Task Scheduler with Queue: Manages task execution in a specific order using a queue.

4. Infix to Postfix Conversion: Uses a stack to convert infix expressions to postfix notation for easier computation.

Each example highlights unique ways stacks and queues optimize problem-solving.
