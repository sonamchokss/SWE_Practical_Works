## This repository implements optimized search algorithms:
1. Linear Search (All Occurrences): Finds and returns all indices of a target value.

2. Binary Search Insertion: Identifies the correct insertion point for a target in a sorted array.

3. Comparison Counter: Tracks comparisons during a search to analyze efficiency.

4. Jump Search with Comparison Count: Quickly locates a target in a sorted array with fewer comparisons.

Each function demonstrates efficient searching and performance tracking for various cases.
