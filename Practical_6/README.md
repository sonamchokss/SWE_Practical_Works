This repository provides an implementation of a singly linked list in Python. It includes the following features:

- Node Class: Represents an individual node in the list, containing data and a next pointer.

- LinkedList Class: Manages the linked list and provides various methods for manipulation:
1. Append: adding a new node to the end of the list.
2. Display: printing all elements in the list in a readable format.
3. Insert: also adding a new node at a specified position in the list.
4. Delete: Removes a node by its value.
5. Search: Finds and returns the position of a node by its value.
6. Reverse: Reverses the order of nodes in the list.

Moreover, each method is designed to manage linked list operations efficiently, demonstrating key linked list functionality.
