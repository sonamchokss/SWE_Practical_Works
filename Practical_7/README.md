This repository implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Python, featuring the following functionalities:

- Node Class: Representing each tree node with a value and pointers to left and right children.

- BinarySearchTree Class: Manages the BST with methods for:
1. Insertion: Adding values while maintaining BST properties.

2. Search: Finding a value in the tree.

3. Traversal: Includes in-order, pre-order, and post-order methods for visiting nodes.

4. Deletion: Removes a specified node, handling cases for nodes with zero, one, or two children.

The code allows for constructing a BST, inserting values, performing traversals, and deleting nodes, demonstrating essential operations for managing a binary search tree.
